I'll analyze the extended simulation results with 100 clock states shown in your image.

Looking at the code, I can see you've increased `D_clock` from 10 to 100 in `quantum_emergence_analysis.py`, which provides a much more detailed view of the system's evolution over a longer effective time period. Let me analyze the results shown in your plots:

## Analysis of Extended Clock State Simulation (D_clock = 100)

### 1. Coherence Dynamics (Top Plot)

The extended simulation reveals fascinating oscillatory patterns in coherence that weren't visible in the shorter simulation:

- **XX Coupling (Blue)**: Shows pronounced oscillations with multiple peaks and valleys, maintaining coherence values up to ~0.025 throughout the evolution. The oscillations appear to have both high-frequency components and a longer-period envelope.

- **ZZ Coupling (Red)**: Maintains zero coherence throughout all 100 clock states, confirming our earlier finding that σz-coupling completely destroys quantum coherence. This is a robust result even over the extended time period.

- **Mixed Coupling (Green)**: Shows similar oscillatory patterns to XX coupling but with reduced amplitude (~0.015 max), demonstrating how the σz component partially suppresses the coherence-preserving effects of the σx component.

- **Recurrence Phenomena**: The system exhibits quasi-periodic behavior with partial recurrences around clock times T=20, T=40, T=60, and T=80, suggesting the system has an intrinsic timescale for coherence dynamics.

### 2. Purity Dynamics (Middle Plot)

The purity evolution shows complex oscillatory behavior for all coupling types:

- **All Coupling Types**: Show similar oscillatory patterns with values ranging between ~0.225 and ~0.375, indicating the system repeatedly cycles between more and less mixed states.

- **Phase Differences**: The three coupling types show phase differences in their oscillations, with ZZ coupling (red) often reaching its purity peaks earlier than the other types.

- **ZZ Coupling Advantage**: The ZZ coupling generally maintains slightly higher purity values on average, consistent with our earlier finding that measurement-like interactions can sometimes better preserve certain quantum properties.

- **Frequency Components**: The purity oscillations show both high-frequency components and longer-term modulations, suggesting multiple timescales in the system-environment dynamics.

### 3. Entanglement Entropy Dynamics (Bottom Plot)

The entropy plot reveals complex system-environment entanglement dynamics:

- **Plateau Regions**: All coupling types show extended plateau regions around entropy ~1.4, indicating periods of stable, high entanglement between system and environment.

- **Sharp Dips**: Interspersed with the plateaus are sharp dips where entropy drops significantly (to ~0.8-1.0), representing moments of partial disentanglement.

- **Synchronization**: The entropy dips for all three coupling types often occur at similar clock times (e.g., T≈25, T≈60, T≈85), suggesting these are driven by the system Hamiltonian rather than the coupling type.

- **Recovery Patterns**: After each dip, the entropy quickly recovers to its plateau value, showing the robustness of system-environment entanglement.

## Physical Insights from Extended Simulation

1. **Quasi-Periodic Behavior**: The extended simulation reveals that quantum coherence, purity, and entanglement all exhibit quasi-periodic behavior, suggesting the system undergoes partial revivals and recurrences.

2. **Coupling-Type Effects Persist**: The fundamental differences between coupling types observed in the shorter simulation remain robust:
   - XX coupling preserves coherence while allowing entanglement
   - ZZ coupling destroys coherence completely
   - Mixed coupling shows intermediate behavior

3. **Multiple Timescales**: The dynamics reveal multiple timescales:
   - Fast oscillations (likely driven by the system energy scale ω)
   - Intermediate recurrences (possibly related to the system-system coupling g)
   - Longer-term modulations (potentially related to environment coupling strengths)

4. **Entanglement Stability**: The plateau regions in entropy suggest the system-environment entanglement reaches a quasi-stable configuration for extended periods, interrupted by brief disentanglement events.

5. **Coherence-Purity Relationship**: The extended simulation confirms that coherence and purity follow different patterns, reinforcing that these are distinct quantum properties affected differently by environment interactions.

## Implications for Emergent Time

In the context of emergent time from the Page-Wootters mechanism:

1. **Time Stability**: The quasi-periodic nature of the dynamics suggests that emergent time in this model has a cyclic character, with partial returns to previous states.

2. **Decoherence Persistence**: The persistent difference between coupling types over 100 clock states demonstrates that the decoherence mechanism is a robust feature of the emergent time dynamics.

3. **Information Flow**: The oscillations in entropy indicate that information flows back and forth between the system and environment, rather than monotonically flowing from system to environment.

4. **Observable Dynamics**: The complex patterns in coherence and purity would manifest as non-trivial dynamics of observables in the emergent time picture, potentially showing revival phenomena.

This extended simulation provides a much richer picture of how quantum information dynamics unfolds within the emergent time framework, revealing complex patterns that weren't visible in the shorter simulation.
