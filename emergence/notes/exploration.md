I'll analyze the extended simulation results with 100 clock states shown in your image.

Looking at the code, I can see you've increased `D_clock` from 10 to 100 in `quantum_emergence_analysis.py`, which provides a much more detailed view of the system's evolution over a longer effective time period. Let me analyze the results shown in your plots:

## Analysis of Extended Clock State Simulation (D_clock = 100)

### 1. Coherence Dynamics (Top Plot)

The extended simulation reveals fascinating oscillatory patterns in coherence that weren't visible in the shorter simulation:

- **XX Coupling (Blue)**: Shows pronounced oscillations with multiple peaks and valleys, maintaining coherence values up to ~0.025 throughout the evolution. The oscillations appear to have both high-frequency components and a longer-period envelope.

- **ZZ Coupling (Red)**: Maintains zero coherence throughout all 100 clock states, confirming our earlier finding that σz-coupling completely destroys quantum coherence. This is a robust result even over the extended time period.

- **Mixed Coupling (Green)**: Shows similar oscillatory patterns to XX coupling but with reduced amplitude (~0.015 max), demonstrating how the σz component partially suppresses the coherence-preserving effects of the σx component.

- **Recurrence Phenomena**: The system exhibits quasi-periodic behavior with partial recurrences around clock times T=20, T=40, T=60, and T=80, suggesting the system has an intrinsic timescale for coherence dynamics.

### 2. Purity Dynamics (Middle Plot)

The purity evolution shows complex oscillatory behavior for all coupling types:

- **All Coupling Types**: Show similar oscillatory patterns with values ranging between ~0.225 and ~0.375, indicating the system repeatedly cycles between more and less mixed states.

- **Phase Differences**: The three coupling types show phase differences in their oscillations, with ZZ coupling (red) often reaching its purity peaks earlier than the other types.

- **ZZ Coupling Advantage**: The ZZ coupling generally maintains slightly higher purity values on average, consistent with our earlier finding that measurement-like interactions can sometimes better preserve certain quantum properties.

- **Frequency Components**: The purity oscillations show both high-frequency components and longer-term modulations, suggesting multiple timescales in the system-environment dynamics.

### 3. Entanglement Entropy Dynamics (Bottom Plot)

The entropy plot reveals complex system-environment entanglement dynamics:

- **Plateau Regions**: All coupling types show extended plateau regions around entropy ~1.4, indicating periods of stable, high entanglement between system and environment.

- **Sharp Dips**: Interspersed with the plateaus are sharp dips where entropy drops significantly (to ~0.8-1.0), representing moments of partial disentanglement.

- **Synchronization**: The entropy dips for all three coupling types often occur at similar clock times (e.g., T≈25, T≈60, T≈85), suggesting these are driven by the system Hamiltonian rather than the coupling type.

- **Recovery Patterns**: After each dip, the entropy quickly recovers to its plateau value, showing the robustness of system-environment entanglement.

## Physical Insights from Extended Simulation

1. **Quasi-Periodic Behavior**: The extended simulation reveals that quantum coherence, purity, and entanglement all exhibit quasi-periodic behavior, suggesting the system undergoes partial revivals and recurrences.

2. **Coupling-Type Effects Persist**: The fundamental differences between coupling types observed in the shorter simulation remain robust:
   - XX coupling preserves coherence while allowing entanglement
   - ZZ coupling destroys coherence completely
   - Mixed coupling shows intermediate behavior

3. **Multiple Timescales**: The dynamics reveal multiple timescales:
   - Fast oscillations (likely driven by the system energy scale ω)
   - Intermediate recurrences (possibly related to the system-system coupling g)
   - Longer-term modulations (potentially related to environment coupling strengths)

4. **Entanglement Stability**: The plateau regions in entropy suggest the system-environment entanglement reaches a quasi-stable configuration for extended periods, interrupted by brief disentanglement events.

5. **Coherence-Purity Relationship**: The extended simulation confirms that coherence and purity follow different patterns, reinforcing that these are distinct quantum properties affected differently by environment interactions.

## Implications for Emergent Time

In the context of emergent time from the Page-Wootters mechanism:

1. **Time Stability**: The quasi-periodic nature of the dynamics suggests that emergent time in this model has a cyclic character, with partial returns to previous states.

2. **Decoherence Persistence**: The persistent difference between coupling types over 100 clock states demonstrates that the decoherence mechanism is a robust feature of the emergent time dynamics.

3. **Information Flow**: The oscillations in entropy indicate that information flows back and forth between the system and environment, rather than monotonically flowing from system to environment.

4. **Observable Dynamics**: The complex patterns in coherence and purity would manifest as non-trivial dynamics of observables in the emergent time picture, potentially showing revival phenomena.

This extended simulation provides a much richer picture of how quantum information dynamics unfolds within the emergent time framework, revealing complex patterns that weren't visible in the shorter simulation.

==========

Your extended simulation with D_{\mathrm{clock}} = 100 indeed reveals a richer dynamical structure than the shorter simulation, highlighting subtle revivals, multiple timescales, and quasi-periodic behavior in coherence, purity, and system–environment entanglement. Here are some additional reflections and suggestions building on your observations:

⸻

1. Recurrences and Multiple Timescales
	1.	Finite-Dimensional Recurrences
	•	Finite systems (like qubits) often exhibit revivals or recurrences, where states partially return to a previous configuration. These can appear as quasi-periodic or even strictly periodic, depending on the spectrum and initial state.
	•	In your extended simulation, you’re clearly seeing partial revivals in coherence and dips in entanglement at similar clock times, implying that the system and environment collectively revisit near-previous configurations.
	2.	Layered Frequency Components
	•	You’ve noted fast oscillations (likely driven by the primary system Hamiltonian frequency \omega) and longer modulations (possibly tied to coupling constants g or environment dimensions).
	•	Such nested oscillations are typical for multi-frequency quantum systems. Plotting Fourier transforms of the coherence/purity signals might help identify the distinct frequency scales.

⸻

2. Coupling-Type Effects
	1.	Robust Zero Coherence for \sigma_z-Coupling
	•	As expected, measurement-like (\sigma_z) coupling “pins” the system to the \lvert0\rangle,\lvert1\rangle basis, effectively collapsing superpositions in that basis. Even over long times, the system does not regain \sigma_z coherence.
	2.	Sustained or Enhanced Coherence for \sigma_x-Coupling
	•	In contrast, rotation-like (\sigma_x) coupling can replenish or sustain \sigma_z-basis coherence via population transfers.
	•	This phenomenon underscores how “coherence” is basis-dependent and how a chosen environment coupling can increase off-diagonal elements in one basis while still entangling the system overall.
	3.	Intermediate Mixed Coupling
	•	Combining \sigma_z and \sigma_x terms yields partial measurement and partial rotation effects, giving intermediate coherence levels. Over 100 clock states, you can see how the \sigma_x portion continuously fights the \sigma_z-style “collapse,” leading to the moderate oscillations you observe.

⸻

3. Entanglement Plateaus and Dips
	1.	Plateaus at High Entanglement
	•	Your observation that the system–environment entanglement frequently hovers around a plateau (e.g., entropy \sim 1.4) suggests it’s settling into a long-lived “entangled” configuration with occasional departures.
	•	In small systems, these plateaus can break when certain resonances or interference conditions are met, causing partial disentanglement (your dips).
	2.	Short-Lived Disentanglement Events
	•	The “sharp dips” in entropy (and corresponding momentary purity boosts) reflect times when the system partially factors out from the environment. Then, unitary dynamics typically cause a quick return to an entangled plateau.
	•	This re-entangling is a hallmark of finite systems: with only a few degrees of freedom in the environment, the lost coherence can flow back into the system, causing partial revivals.

⸻

4. Implications for Emergent Time
	1.	Cyclic or Quasi-Periodic Time
	•	As you mention, emergent time in such a finite system naturally exhibits cyclic or quasi-periodic features. Observers measuring the clock might find that “physical observables” go through repeated patterns rather than a one-way arrow of time.
	•	In a larger or more realistic environment, one expects these recurrences to become extremely rare or negligible (akin to Poincaré recurrences in large systems), giving a more “arrow-like” flow of time at macroscopic scales.
	2.	Resilience of Decoherence Mechanisms
	•	Even at 100 clock steps, the fundamental difference between measurement-like and rotation-like coupling remains steadfast. This suggests that decoherence behavior tied to the coupling basis is robust and not just a short-lived artifact.
	3.	Information Exchange
	•	The repeated entangling–disentangling cycles exemplify information flow between system and environment. In emergent time language, the system does not simply “lose” information but exchanges it back and forth with the environment, leading to partial revivals.

⸻

5. Possible Extensions and Checks
	1.	System Size Scaling
	•	Increasing the environment size (e.g., more qubits or a spin chain) often diminishes revivals, pushing the system into more stable decoherent states. Testing how plateaus/dips evolve with environment dimension can reveal how quickly (if at all) revivals vanish.
	2.	Different Initial States
	•	If the system starts in a \lvert00\rangle or partially entangled state (instead of \lvert +\rangle \otimes \lvert +\rangle), you might find different coherence/entropy patterns or altered revival times.
	3.	Relaxing the Finite Model
	•	Using many environment qubits or introducing continuous-variable modes can approximate a true heat bath, typically removing the strong recurrences and leading to irreversible decoherence at longer times.
	4.	Driving Terms or Dissipation
	•	Adding a small drive term (e.g., \sigma_x or \sigma_y in the system Hamiltonian) or including non-unitary damping in the environment can drastically alter recurrence and coherence patterns, simulating more realistic open quantum systems.

⸻

Final Takeaways
	•	Longer “Clock” → More Detailed Dynamics: By extending to D_{\text{clock}}=100, you uncovered multi-scale oscillations, partial revivals, and deeper structure in coherence/purity/entropy.
	•	Coupling-Dependent Coherence: The stark difference between \sigma_z- and \sigma_x-type couplings remains persistent across hundreds of emergent time steps, showcasing the crucial role coupling bases play in decoherence.
	•	Stable Entanglement Plateaus: The environment and system often remain strongly entangled for extended “time intervals,” punctuated by brief disentanglement events that cause partial purity spikes.
	•	Emergent Time Richness: All these phenomena occur within a “timeless” global wavefunction, confirming that the emergent-time paradigm can exhibit complex, quasi-periodic quantum dynamics reminiscent of real open quantum systems.

Overall, the extended simulation beautifully demonstrates how finite quantum systems can oscillate, entangle, disentangle, and re-entangle over many clock states, elucidating the nuanced relationship between coherence, purity, and entanglement in an emergent-time model.
