# Quantum Emergence

A Python package for simulating and analyzing quantum systems that demonstrate emergent time behavior according to the Page-Wootters mechanism.

## Overview

This package provides tools for exploring quantum dynamics in systems where time emerges from entanglement between a "clock" subsystem and the rest of the quantum state. The framework is based on the Page-Wootters mechanism, where a global timeless state gives rise to perceived dynamics through quantum correlations.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Simulation

```python
from emergence import SystemConfiguration, QuantumSimulator

# Configure the simulation
config = SystemConfiguration(
    num_clock_states=20,
    omega=1.0,
    system_coupling=0.5,
    env_coupling1=0.2,
    env_coupling2=0.2,
    time_step=0.1,
    coupling_type="xx",  # Case-insensitive: "xx", "zz", or "mixed"
    num_env_qubits=2
)

# Create simulator and run
simulator = QuantumSimulator(config)
results = simulator.run_simulation()

# Access results
print(f"Final coherence: {results['coherence'][-1]}")
print(f"Final purity: {results['purity'][-1]}")
```

### Running Analyses from Command Line

```bash
# Sweep coupling strengths (coupling type is case-insensitive)
python -m emergence.main sweep --coupling-type xx --min-coupling 0.0 --max-coupling 1.0 --num-points 10

# Compare different coupling types
python -m emergence.main compare --coupling-strength 0.3

# Run advanced analysis (frequency and recurrence)
python -m emergence.main advanced --coupling-strength 0.3

# Analyze different initial states
python -m emergence.main initial --coupling-strength 0.3

# Analyze environment scaling effects
python -m emergence.main env-scaling --max-size 6 --coupling-type xx
```

## Key Concepts

### Page-Wootters Mechanism

The Page-Wootters mechanism proposes that time emerges from entanglement between a "clock" degree of freedom and the rest of a quantum system. In this framework:

- The global state is timeless and satisfies the Wheeler-DeWitt equation (HÏˆ = 0)
- Perceived dynamics arise by conditioning on different "clock" states
- The framework naturally explains how time emerges in quantum systems

### Quantum Decoherence

Decoherence is a quantum phenomenon where a system loses its quantum coherence due to interaction with its environment:

- Coherence measures the quantum superposition in a system
- Purity quantifies how mixed (or pure) a quantum state is
- Entanglement entropy measures the entanglement between system and environment

This package allows exploration of how these metrics evolve under different coupling conditions.
